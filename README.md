# Mining-Stake (WIP)

This repository contains files related to the staking of RTC (RTCoin).

When you lock in your RTC, for the ENTIRE duration of your lockup you will be granted the exact hash rate that you were granted at the time of lockup. For example, at the time of your lockup you were granted 1000hash/sec and you locked up your RTC for 18 weeks, you will be granted 1000hash/sec for the entire 18 weeks.


# What does staking RTC do?

By staking RTC, you gain access to the profits made at some of RTrades mining farms.

There will be a floating fee of $10 USD paid in ethereum to stake RTC with the system however this will be voided for the first 100 people to stake RTC.

The amount of time that you lock RTC up for is up to you, as long as it is a minimum of 4 weeks.

Payouts will be made on a 24 hour basis in the form of additional RTCoins. RTCoins earned from mining payouts are *immediately* liquid, and will be tradable for BNT through our RTC-BNT Token Relay.

The RTCoin that was locked up in the initial stake are non-liquid until the lockup duration is over (default 4 weeks)


# Costs to stake?

With the RTC starting evaluation of $0.125/RTC, the total cost for 1 hash/sec is $0.5625, or 4.5RTC.

This figure is an initial estimate for testing purposes. The actual values may change before the staking contract is pushed to production
