# What does staking RTC do?

By staking RTC, you gain access to the profits made at some of RTrades mining farms.
There will be a floating fee of $10 USD paid in ethereum to stake RTC with the system however this will be voided for the first 100 people to stake RTC.
The amount of time that you lock RTC up for is up to you, as long as it is a minimum of 4 weeks.
